The first project is a database creation project made using SQL OUT. It is made using MSaccess, but it is transferable to other DBMSs.


The data manipulation project is a passion project that I made before I got accepted into my current Master's degree program.  
It uses both SQL IN and SQL OUT to achieve 2NF or even 3NF subjectively speaking.
It also contains some data cleaning and manipulation.
You can find the Table that I used for my data manipulation project here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html


Also completed a python group project:

The project uses python to perform data cleaning, basic data analysis, and data visualization
