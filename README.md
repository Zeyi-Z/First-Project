**The first project is a database creation project made using SQL OUT.** 


**The data manipulation project is something I made before I got accepted into my current Master's degree program.**  
It uses both SQL IN and SQL OUT to achieve 2NF or even 3NF subjectively speaking.
It also contains some data cleaning and manipulation.
You can find the Table that I used for my data manipulation project here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html


## **Also completed a python group project:**
